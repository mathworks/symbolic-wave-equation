# Symbolic Wave Equation

[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=mathworks/symbolic-wave-equation&file=waveEquationReport.mlx)

## Description
10 minute demo going from a blank page to verifying that a particular function satisfies the wave equation.

## Purpose
Introduce some capabilities of Symbolic Math Toolbox&trade; and Live Scripts&trade;, including formatting, Live Tasks, entering equations, Live Controls and publishing.

Scenario:
Someone gave me this solution to the wave equation:
$$sol=\frac{cos(x-ct)}{2}+\frac{cos(x+ct)}{2}$$
I remember from d'Alembert that $f(x-ct)+f(x+ct)$ should satisfy the equation, but let's verify...

This is the Wave Equation:
$\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2 }u=c^2 \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2 }u$
